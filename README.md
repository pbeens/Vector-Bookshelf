# Vector-Bookshelf
A standalone, AI-augmented research engine for local eBook libraries. Unlike traditional managers, it ignores external databases to extract metadata (Author, Year, Title) directly from file headers and uses NLP to derive deep-content tags. It features a D3.js relationship graph to visualize connections across your entire research collection.
