# Current Categorization Process

## 1. Learning Phase (AI)

The system learns relationships between specific tags (e.g., "Space Opera") and Master Categories (e.g., "Science-Fiction") using a local LLM.

1. **Tag Discovery**:
    * Scans the database for all unique tags currently in use on books.
    * Compares against the existing `taxonomy.json` file.
    * Identifies **NEW** tags that have never been seen before.

2. **Batch Processing**:
    * **Batch Size**: 500 tags per request.
    * **Model**: Local LLM via LM Studio (e.g., Llama 3, BitNet).
    * **Temperature**: 0.1 (Low randomness for consistency).

3. **The Prompt**:
    > Analyze this list of specific book tags: [List of 500 tags]
    >
    > Your goal is to map each tag to ONE of the following "Master Categories":
    > [List: Fiction, Non-Fiction, Science-Fiction, Fantasy, History, Self-Help, etc.]
    >
    > CRITICAL RULES:
    > 1. DO NOT use generic terms like "General", "Book", "Novel".
    > 2. "Fiction" and "Non-Fiction" ARE allowed for generic tags.
    > 3. Use "Science-Fiction" instead of "Sci-Fi".
    > 4. Return ONLY a valid JSON object.

4. **Storage**:
    * The learned mappings are saved to `taxonomy.json` so the AI never has to process the same tag twice.

## 2. Application Phase (Deterministic)

Once the `taxonomy.json` map is built, the system applies categories to books **offline** (CPU only).

1. **For Each Book**:
    * Load the book's specific tags (e.g., `"Elves, Magic, World Studies"`).
    * **Lookup**: Convert each tag to its Master Category using the map:
        * `Elves` -> `Fantasy`
        * `Magic` -> `Fantasy`
        * `World Studies` -> `History`

2. **Scoring (Winner Takes All)**:
    * Count the votes:
        * Fantasy: 2
        * History: 1
    * **Result**: The book is primarily **Fantasy**.

3. **Tag Pruning**:
    * If a sub-tag is redundant (e.g., book has `"Fantasy"` tag and category is `Fantasy`), the redundant tag is hidden from the UI to reduce clutter, but kept in the database.
